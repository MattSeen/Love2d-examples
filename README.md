Who Am I?
=========

In the not too distant past I made a desicion that I wanted to learn how to make a video game. I grew up being fasinated by them and made a commitment that I wanted to be a software programmer in Japan. The main reason for that was I knew Square Enix (I loved Final Fantasy on the PS1) were based in Japan and knew that's where I wanted to be. Fast forward many years and I never got the whole programming when I was young off the ground. Coming from the country side, going to school in a small town and not having any other friends who were into this stuff in the same way, I never pursued it.

I went on to study engineering and find myself as a full time programmer. I've messed around with that young ambition over the years but didn't really get anywhere with it. Until recently.

What is this?
=============

So here I will try and build up a series of games and basic game programming princples, in full view of the public. Hopefully some of what you find here could be of some use.

I'm using LOVE2D as it was recommended to me by a good friend Felix Wunderlich. You might of played his game [Plazma Being](http://www.indiedb.com/games/plazma-being).

How to run these games
======================

You'll need a copy of LOVE2D 0.8 installed. Each folder will be structured in the same way:

GameName
 -> game
  -> all of the files
  
Go into the particular Game, such as GameOfLife and drag & drop the folder "game" onto the LOVE2D executable (if you are on Windows).
